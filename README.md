Converts frame rate while maintaining visual timing of animations and easing curves. Just enter a frame rate and hit Apply! 

Note that this will only modify comp duration, keyframe position and layer timing. It will not modify any stagger, oscillator or similar procedural elements.

## Easey

Adds a speed graph and allows cubic-bezier notation for easing between two keyframes. Makes easing easy. 

You can also save presets, and copy duration and easing values to pass to developers.

If you're looking for a more polished value graph editor that supports Magic Easing, check out Curves at Scenery.io. Make sure to download "easey_assets" as well.

## Renamer

Makes renaming layers and project items simple. Find & replace, append and prepend, and number assets with ease.

## CSS Gradient Converter
Converts CSS gradient syntax (linear-gradient) to a Gradient Shader.

## Reduce Compositions
Select the compositions you want to keep and run this script to remove the rest. Pair with Remove Unused Assets to quickly clean up a file.

## Remove Unused Assets
Removes all assets not used in a composition.

## Set All Image Shaders to Mipmaps
