Converts frame rate while maintaining visual timing of animations and easing curves. Just enter a frame rate and hit Apply! 

> [!NOTE]
> This will only modify comp duration, keyframe placement and layer timing. It will not modify any stagger, oscillator or similar procedural elements.

## Remove Unused Assets
Removes all assets not used in a composition.

## Set All Image Shaders to Mipmaps

#### When exporting CSV
1. Rename the "originalValue" column to your default language
2. Add as many new column to the right as you like and title them with their corresponding language
3. Enter new translations for each line. Leave a cell blank to keep the original text.
4. Import back into Localiser and either choose language to apply, or duplicate all comps automatically with new values.

## Find and Replace Text
Searches all strings in the file and allows you to batch find/replace lines of text. Supports regex.

# Developer Tools

## Check Update from Github
Simple script to compare update versions against a json file and log a console alert.

### Notes
Some scripts make web API calls simply to check for updates.
